    <h1>REST API testing strategy</h1>
    <p>The API layer of any application is the channel that connects the client to the server (or one microservice to another), manages business processes,
      and exposes services that provide value to users. A client-facing public API that is made open to end users becomes a product in itself. If it breaks, it will put at risk
      not only one application, but the whole chain of business processes built around it.
    </p>

  <h3>API testing steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check if the HTTP status code is correct.</strong>
        <p>For example, resource creation should return 201 CREATED and denied requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Check the response payload.</strong>
        <p>Check the correctness of the JSON body, names, types, and values ​​of the response fields,
        including in responses to erroneous requests.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Check the response headers.</strong>
        <p>HTTP server headers affect both security and performance.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Check if the application state is correct.</strong>
        <p>This is optional and applies mainly to manual testing or when the user interface
        or other interface can be easily tested.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Check basic functionality.</strong>
        <p>If the operation completed successfully, but took an unreasonably long time, the test failed.</p></li>
    </ol>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h3>Categories of Test Cases</h3>
  <p>Our test cases are divided into the following general groups of test scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Major positive tests (passing a successful scenario by default)</li>
    <li>Extended positive testing with additional parameters</li>
    <li>Negative testing with valid inputs</li>
    <li>Negative testing with invalid inputs</li>
    <li>Destructive testing</li>
    <li>Security, authorization and accessibility tests</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>API as a convention</h3>
    <p>An API is essentially an agreement between a client and a server, or between two applications. This can be done by first checking the specification (or the service
        convention itself, such as the Swagger interface or an OpenAPI reference) and making sure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>endpoints are correctly named;</li>
      <li>resources and their types correctly reflect the object model;</li>
      <li>no missing or duplicate functionality;</li>
      <li>relationships between resources are correctly reflected in the API.</li>
    </ul>
